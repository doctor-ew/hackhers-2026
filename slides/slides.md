<div class="source">Inspired by Chorouk Malmoum’s LinkedIn post · supplied screenshot · workshop adaptation</div>

<!--
Spend about one minute here. The screenshot contrasts copilot and autopilot as ways of using AI. This slide paraphrases that perspective; it is not an empirical classification of people or a claim that using AI causes skill loss. Copilot here is a metaphor, not a product name. Useful automation can still run autonomously within clear boundaries; the team owns the goal, acceptance criteria, and consequential decisions. Beginners can practice this too: predict what a change should do, ask for an explanation, test it, and explain what they learned. Ask pairs: if the demo fails, can you explain what you expected and which evidence you would inspect? Then connect this habit to the spec, challenger, and repair loop.

<!--
Budget about one minute per engineering slide. These are design lenses for the team’s eventual software, not claims that the prompt-only coach implements a database or object model. DRY concerns duplicated knowledge: similar-looking code need not represent the same rule. Avoid inventing an abstraction before the shared responsibility is clear. Convention over configuration means tools understand defaults; merely agreeing on names is not automatic discovery.

# SOLID: make change manageable.

<div class="artifact"><p><strong>S — Single Responsibility:</strong> one reason to change per module.</p><p><strong>O — Open/Closed:</strong> support extensions without changing stable code.</p><p><strong>L — Liskov Substitution:</strong> replacements honor the original contract.</p><p><strong>I — Interface Segregation:</strong> expose only what each client needs.</p><p><strong>D — Dependency Inversion:</strong> depend on abstractions, not concrete details.</p></div><div class="takeaway">Example: separate availability rules from storage and notifications.</div>

<div class="source"><a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2020/10/18/Solid-Relevance.html">Robert C. Martin: SOLID relevance</a> · Authored project example</div>

<!--
SOLID groups five design principles. Single responsibility groups things that change for the same reason. For the scheduling example, changing how messages are sent should not change availability rules. A replacement storage adapter must preserve the caller’s expectations, including failures. A reader should not need a write interface. Keep abstractions proportionate to the project; five principles do not require five classes or a large architecture.

# ACID: protect a database transaction.

<div class="four"><section><h3>A — Atomicity</h3><p>All changes in the transaction succeed together, or none take effect.</p></section><section><h3>C — Consistency</h3><p>A successful transaction preserves defined data rules and constraints.</p></section><section><h3>I — Isolation</h3><p>Concurrent transactions interact according to the isolation level.</p></section><section><h3>D — Durability</h3><p>Committed changes survive failures under the database’s guarantees.</p></section></div><div class="takeaway">Example: reserve a seat and update capacity in one transaction.</div>

<div class="source"><a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/iis/11.7.0?topic=transactions-transaction-properties">IBM: transaction properties</a> · Authored project example</div>

<!--
The booking example extends beyond the manual MVP. If the second database write fails, atomicity prevents a partial booking. Define capacity constraints and choose concurrency control appropriate to the reservation rule; a transaction alone does not prevent every race. Serializable isolation aims for results equivalent to a serial order; weaker levels permit some anomalies. Consistency means preserving defined invariants, not proving user-entered facts true. An external email is not automatically part of a database transaction. ACID describes database behavior, not a guarantee made by a prompt.

<!--
Assume fixed-cost indexed reads, per-entry checks, and pair comparisons. The growth multipliers describe operation counts for these examples, not guaranteed wall-clock time. Big O ignores constant factors and lower-order terms for sufficiently large input. It is an upper bound, not automatically a tight bound or a synonym for worst case. Database indexes, network calls, and model calls require their own cost analysis. Measure before optimizing a tiny hackathon workload.

<!--
The test target is the team’s newly built coach, not the completed prompt on reference/completed-coach. Confirm the actual loaded path with the team. For a praise-versus-commitment acceptance case, use a clearly synthetic student input and compare the generated response with the approved expectation. A passing result supports only the behaviors exercised. If the case passes immediately, run a harder case or another requirement; never manufacture a failure or repair story. For failures preserve before/after responses and explain the actual change. This checkpoint is the workshop’s principal demonstration of what students built.

<!--
None of these workflows is required for this workshop. Present each as a way to organize engineering work, without ranking them. Nightshift is Drew’s workflow example; its stages cover specification, implementation, review, and verification with recorded evidence. The organizer-supplied screenshots open full size. The stage screenshot shows the run blocked at preflight; earlier green stages do not establish successful deployment. The usage screenshot explicitly shows partial usage and a provider estimate, with actual billed cost unknown. Do not present these as a completed run or verified total cost. Today students practice the underlying decisions directly in Claude Code. Adopt a workflow when its structure helps the team; installation itself is not evidence of correctness.
